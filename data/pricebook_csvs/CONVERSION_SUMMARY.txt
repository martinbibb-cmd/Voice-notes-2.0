- PDF processed: 23 pages
- All major sections identified and classified
- Subsection-aware classification implemented
- No data loss - all 2,001 component rows successfully extracted
- Prices cleaned (£ and commas removed)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------
- Some items may have truncated descriptions if line wrapping occurred

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
For boiler-specific enhanced CSVs (with kW, fuel type, flue size columns):
- Extend schema with product-specific fields
- Add boiler kW extraction from description
- Add fuel type normalization (NG/LPG)
- Add flue diameter field for flue components
